        Was Phileas Fogg rich? Undoubtedly. But those who knew him best could not imagine how he had made his fortune,
        and Mr. Fogg was the last person to whom to apply for the information. He was not lavish, nor, on the contrary,
        avaricious; for, whenever he knew that money was needed for a noble, useful, or benevolent purpose, he supplied
        it quietly and sometimes anonymously. He was, in short, the least communicative of men. He talked very little,
        and seemed all the more mysterious for his taciturn manner. His daily habits were quite open to observation; but
        whatever he did was so exactly the same thing that he had always done before, that the wits of the curious were
        fairly puzzled.

        The mansion in Saville Row, though not sumptuous, was exceedingly comfortable. The habits of its occupant were
        such as to demand but little from the sole domestic, but Phileas Fogg required him to be almost superhumanly
        prompt and regular. On this very 2nd of October he had dismissed James Forster, because that luckless youth had
        brought him shaving-water at eighty-four degrees Fahrenheit instead of eighty-six; and he was awaiting his
        successor, who was due at the house between eleven and half-past.
