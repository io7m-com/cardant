    <Paragraph>
      The server maintains an append-only <Term type="term">audit log</Term> consisting of a series of
      <Term type="term">audit events</Term>. An <Term type="term">audit event</Term> has an integer
      <Term type="term">id</Term>, an <Term type="term">owner</Term> (represented by an account UUID),
      a <Term type="term">timestamp</Term>, a <Term type="term">type</Term>, and a
      <Term type="term">message</Term> consisting of a set of key/value pairs.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Each operation that changes the underlying database typically results in an event being logged
      to the audit log.
