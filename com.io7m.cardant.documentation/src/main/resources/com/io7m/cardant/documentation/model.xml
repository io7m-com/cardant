        An <Term type="term">item</Term> is an object that is tracked by the inventory system. When the
        <Term type="package">cardant</Term>
        package refers to items, it should more accurately be understood to be referring to
        <Term type="term">classes</Term> of items. That is, the inventory system tracks sets of items of a given class
        within <Link target="d5fa706f-6150-4c71-b5be-311e2680b89a">locations</Link>. An item has
        associated <Link target="64b850d6-ee2a-4e44-bc8a-7a04da7530fc">metadata</Link>, an identifier that uniquely
        identifies the item class, zero or more
        <Link target="32d947cf-5f95-4576-b5f7-104a5a3b82f6">types</Link>

        <Term type="term">Metadata</Term>
        is data associated with an item that describes that item. Items can have any number of metadata values, and
        inventory managers can introduce strong requirements on the presence and types of metadata on items through the

        A <Term type="term">type</Term> is a label that can be applied to an item that will constrain the
        <Link target="64b850d6-ee2a-4e44-bc8a-7a04da7530fc">metadata</Link>
        associated with that item. A <Term type="term">type</Term> on an item refers to a
        <Term type="term">type declaration</Term>
        created by the inventory manager. A
        <Term type="term">type declaration</Term>
        is essentially a
        <Term type="term">record type</Term>
        in the sense that it defines a set of named metadata values along with their individual
        <Link target="e0f0dda3-ecba-4571-8464-2a0f81ed25c6">scalar types</Link>.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Types are intended to ensure the integrity and quality of metadata associated with items, and allow for more
        precise searching. For example, inventory managers might define a <Term type="type">voltage_regulator</Term> type
        that is applied to electronics components within the inventory that are voltage regulators. The
        <Term type="type">voltage_regulator</Term>
        type might be declared to require that metadata includes numeric values
        <Term type="type">input_voltage</Term>
        and
        <Term type="type">output_voltage</Term>
        that describe the input and output voltages of the regulator. Any attempt to update an item that has the
        <Term type="type">voltage_regulator</Term>
        type applied without providing values for the
        <Term type="type">input_voltage</Term>
        and <Term type="type">output_voltage</Term> metadata will be rejected with a clear error message.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        As mentioned, types are intended to facilitate more precise searching. It is possible to, for example, search
        for all items in the inventory that have an <Term type="type">output_voltage</Term> metadata value, but this
        does not imply that all the returned items will be voltage regulators. With a well-designed and well-managed
        inventory, one can simply search for all items that have the type
        <Term type="type">voltage_regulator</Term>
        (and then perhaps narrow down the search by asking for only those items that have an
        <Term type="type">output_voltage</Term>
        value equal to <Term type="type">5.0</Term>).

        Items can have zero or more <Term type="term">attachments</Term>. An attachment is simply a file associated with

      <Paragraph>
        For example, an inventory manager that is managing
        an inventory that contains rolls of passive electronics components such as
        <LinkExternal target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor">resistors</LinkExternal> would use set
        instances to describe sets of resistors in the inventory. The resistors
        themselves do not have serial numbers or any kind of individual identity and therefore there is no reason

      <Paragraph>
        For example, an inventory manager that is managing an inventory that
        contains musical instruments would use serial instances to identify individual instruments in
        the inventory. Instruments of each type are distinguished from other instruments of the
        same type by way of <Term type="term">serial numbers</Term>. A <Term type="term">serial number</Term>
        in the <Term type="package">cardant</Term> package is an arbitrary string. Serial numbers are unique for a

        the same serial numbers for their products. Within a single manufacturer's product range, however, serial
        numbers will most assuredly be unique.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        The hierarchical nature of locations can be used to model different kinds of inventory arrangements. For
        example, a manager of computer laboratories might define <Term type="term">Laboratory A</Term> and
        <Term type="term">Laboratory B</Term>
        locations. Within those locations, the manager might define locations
        <Term type="term">Computer A1</Term>, <Term type="term">Computer A2</Term>,
        <Term type="term">Computer A3</Term>, and so on. Within the <Term type="term">Computer A1</Term> location, the
        manager might place a single motherboard <Link target="98e6044d-2cd6-4646-be40-cf57695ee9e7">item</Link>, one or
        more CPU items, and so on, from the inventory. This allows the manager to know what computer parts they have,
        and the computers in which those parts are being used in the laboratories under their supervision. Additionally,
        should one assembled computer be moved from one laboratory to another, the manager can simply reparent the
        computer location to the new laboratory.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Conversely, a manager of a retail business might define a <Term type="term">Storage Room A</Term> location, and
        then within that location, define <Term type="term">Shelf A01</Term>,
        <Term type="term">Shelf A02</Term>, <Term type="term">Shelf A03</Term>, etc. The manager can then place items
        onto those storage shelf locations. This allows the manager to track what stock they have, and exactly where
        they're keeping each kind of item.

        <Link target="32d947cf-5f95-4576-b5f7-104a5a3b82f6">Types</Link> are introduced into
        a running <Term type="package">cardant</Term> server using <Term type="term">type packages</Term>.
        A <Term type="term">type package</Term> is simply a named, versioned container of types that can
        be uploaded and installed into the server's database atomically.

      <Paragraph>
        Type packages are identified by their <Term type="term">name</Term> and <Term type="term">version</Term>.
        It is not permitted to have two packages with the same name but different versions installed at the same
        time. A type package name is a
        <LinkExternal target="https://www.io7m.com/software/lanark/">Lanark</LinkExternal> dotted name (such
        as <Term type="expression">com.io7m.example</Term>) and the types declared within the package have their
        names derived by concatenating their unqualified names onto the end of the package name. So, for example,
        a package <Term type="expression">com.io7m.example</Term> that contains a scalar type named
        <Term type="expression">t</Term> will cause the scalar type <Term type="expression">com.io7m.example:t</Term>
        to be created on the server when the package is installed.

    <Subsection title="Imports">
      <Paragraph>
        A type package may <Term type="term">import</Term> other type packages. An <Term type="term">import</Term>
        consists of a <Link target="56df9b58-93ac-4444-b76e-aacacd0e88ce">package name</Link> and
        a <Term type="term">version range</Term>. When a user tries to install a type package
        <Term type="expression">p</Term>, each import <Term type="expression">i</Term> declared by
        <Term type="expression">p</Term> is examined, and the server inspects its own set of installed
        packages and verifies that a package is installed with both a name that matches <Term type="expression">i</Term>
        and a version that falls within the range declared by <Term type="expression">i</Term>. If no such package
        exists, the type package installation is rejected and the system is left untouched.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        For the sake of simplicity, and because the number of installed type packages is expected to be small
        and not change particularly often, imports are merely an install-time check. It is possible (but heavily
        discouraged) for type packages to refer to types in packages that they have not imported.
