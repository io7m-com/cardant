  <Subsection title="Overview">
    <Paragraph>
      All command execution in the <Term type="package">cardant</Term> server passes through a
      single code path that captures <LinkExternal target="https://opentelemetry.io/">OpenTelemetry</LinkExternal>
      traces and publishes events. Administrators should write alerting rules in their metrics system of choice to
      watch for instances of the traces, metrics, and events described here; they almost certainly indicate malicious
      behaviour.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      At the time of writing, <Term type="term">events</Term> are published as part of a containing
      <Term type="term">trace</Term>, and therefore the server must be
      <Link target="1e5d55f4-0334-4613-bd0c-8e307de47af7">configured</Link> to publish traces in order
      for an external monitoring system to be able to observe the events. The
      reason for this is that the OpenTelemetry Events API specification is not yet stable and so
      traces are currently the only way to publish events. It is expected that a stable version of the
      Events API will be released soon, and then the <Term type="package">cardant</Term> server will
      switch to using that API directly (and this will require only
      <Link target="dea6eac7-9436-46aa-839a-a018ed497913">log</Link> telemetry to be configured
      as opposed to full trace collection).

  <Subsection title="Security Policy Violations">
    <Paragraph>
      If an operation attempts to violate the server's built-in security policy, an exception
      will be raised with an <Term type="expression">cardant.errorCode</Term> attribute set to
      <Term type="expression">error-security-policy-denied</Term>.
